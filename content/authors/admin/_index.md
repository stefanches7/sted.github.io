I am interested in life and brain structure and function, and in the ways in which those can be described mathematically. To this extend, I have accomplished projects involving Machine Learning, Cognitive Simulations, Gene Expression, Signal Processing and Dynamic Systems Analysis. This practical experience is backed by the profound theoretical training in Signal Processing, Neuro-inspired Systems Engineering and Neurology I have received during the Master of Science in Neuroengineering. Apart from that, I try to come up with new ideas in the Neural Information Processing/Neural Signall Processing field and be open to the new developments of Science and Technology in the branch. If you are interested in collaboration, do not hesitate to use contact forms provided under the avatar.

In my free time I enjoy meeting new people and doing hobbies.
