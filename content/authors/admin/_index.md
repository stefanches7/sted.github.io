I am passionate about the ability to record human brain activity and use this signal to control machines, as well as understanding how brains convey information. Furthermore, I find it interesting how intelligence can arise in computational paradigms from a set of predefined (simple) rules. I am passionate about collecting and processing data which leads to new insights and optimizations.
