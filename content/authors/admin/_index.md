I am passionate about technological developments of humanity on the cutting edge. Having work experience in academia, industry and tech I have seen processes of Software Development, Big Data operations and adjacent to them from many sides. In addition to the "technical" side of my skills I try to generalize my observations in my work and life, the ultimum of it being my scientific interests in Human Brain information processing, Machine Learning and Dynamic Systems Modelling. If you are interested in collaboration, do not hesitate to use contact forms provided under my picture.
