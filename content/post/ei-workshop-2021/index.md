EI workshop was one of the best experience I have made not only with online conferences, but conferences overall. 
The panel discussions were so, as I imagine the appropriate interdisciplinary work to take place - a session of engineers, biologists, computational 
neuroscientists and philosophers doing contributions in a single, but very broad topic of Embodied Cognition and learning from
each other. Researchers of the previous generation, which in my experience can sometimes be too dug up "in their own work" talking about 
history of different things and sharing their experience. Listening to them was one of the most knowledge-rich experiences in my life 
in academia as a young scientific trainee!\
The talk I gave was entitled to be a Open Crazy Topic :D and I was a youngest panelist; nevertheless I did not feel excluded
from discussion and questions round. People were polite to each other and question rounds had appropriate diversity and timing. 
Overall it was a great experience of acceptive, open community, a well organized conference and really interesting and interdisciplinary
panel discussions!
